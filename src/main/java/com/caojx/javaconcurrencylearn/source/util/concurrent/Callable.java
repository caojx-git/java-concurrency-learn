/**
 * 对于Runnable的接口定义来看，并不能满足我们的要求，Runnable一般仅仅用于定义一个可以被线程执行的任务，它的run方法没有返回值
 * 所以JDK提供了另一个接口——Callable，表示一个具有返回结果的任务
 * <p>
 * A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.
 * Implementors define a single method with no arguments called
 * {@code call}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Callable} interface is similar to {@link
 * Runnable}, in that both are designed for classes whose
 * instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A
 * {@code Runnable}, however, does not return a result and cannot
 * throw a checked exception.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class contains utility methods to
 * convert from other common forms to {@code Callable} classes.
 *
 * @param <V> the result type of method {@code call}
